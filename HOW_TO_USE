Compile the src/syscallapi.s source file with GNU Assembler (GAS) into an object file. To do this, use the following command:

bash $ as -o src/syscallapi.o src/syscallapi.s

Include the include/syscallapi.h header file in your project to use the necessary functions and macros.

Link your application object file with the syscallapi.o object file compiled in step one using the following command:

bash $ gcc -o your_application your_application.o src/syscallapi.o

After completing these steps, your project is ready to use the functions from syscallapi.
